Currently working on an ambitious MRI scans brain tumor classification project. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), transfer learning, and cutting-edge techniques. to maximize accuracy Implemented data augmentation, segmentation, and time testing augmentation for enhanced dataset quality. Through the project Iâ€™m honing Python and deep learning skills to create a robust model.
